# Strings and Loops

Now that we know that strings are basically lists in disguise, we can start to harness the power of loops with them.

Let's look a bit further into **string slicing**.



## Using a for loop


ðŸ‘‰ This `for` loop creates a variable called *letter*. It is used to store each character in the string as the loop goes through it, starting at the first character.

The `print` statement uses the *letter* variable and will output the string one character at a time (like a list).


```python
myString = "Day 38"
for letter in myString:
  print(letter)

# This code outputs:
#D
#a
#y

#3
#8
# this is a comment in the code, the computer will ignore it
```
This means that we can do certain things to certain characters inside the loop.

## if statement inside the loop


ðŸ‘‰ This code will examine the lower case version of each character. If it's an *'a'*, the computer will change the font color to yellow before printing.

Outside of the loop, the last line sets the font color back to default for the next character in the loop.

```python
myString = "Day 38"
for letter in myString:
  if letter.lower() == "a":
    print('\033[33m', end='') #yellow
  print(letter)
  print('\033[0m', end='') #back to default

# This code outputs (with a yellow 'a'):
#D
#a
#y

#3
#8
```
## Using a list to specify search items

ðŸ‘‰ If the letters are in my list called *vowels*, they will `print` out in yellow.  


I changed the `print` statement on the last line back to the default color with the ending system.

```python
vowels = ["a","e","i","o","u"]

myString = "Will my vowels now be yellow?"
for letter in myString:
  
  if letter.lower() in vowels:
    print('\033[33m', end='') #yellow
    
  print(letter, end="")
  print('\033[0m', end='') #back to default
```

```python
#This is a comment. It is only for you. The computer will ignore it.
```
